| Threat | Primary control |
|---|---|
| Injection | AEGIS + CROWN |
| Authorization bypass | PDP + fail-closed ABAC + capability registry |
| Approval replay | nonce + expiry + replay registry |
| Ledger tampering | canonical event hash + integrity seal + append-only DB role |
| Knowledge poisoning | IKES provenance + epistemic state + corroboration |
| Cache poisoning | authority-bound cache keys and verifier before commit |
| Evolution abuse | proposal domain + evidence + lifecycle + human approval |
| Tenant breakout | tenant isolation before capability evaluation |
| Provider failure | model registry/fallback contracts + observable SLOs |
